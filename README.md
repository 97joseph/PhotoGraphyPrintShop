# PhotoGraphyPrintShop

A phot print shop

I need a website built preferably in Wordpress that can be hosted on existing hosting that I have. I am open to other suggestions, however they must be able to be hosted on my existing hosting, as I do not want to pay another set of hosting through another provider. The hosting I have is already in use with a number of other websites.

This website needs to feature my photography images in a stunning way, allowing visitors to recognise the quality of the images and feel comfortable with the professional quality, and making people want to purchase the images for their homes. The site will need to integrate my shopify print store.

Please note that although I would like a services page, this is not the main focus of the website - the WHOLE focus needs to be about selling prints, however I don't just want a shop, I want a carefully, beautifully designed, portfolio website that shows off my photography, which will encourage people to purchase prints.

I have attached some images I am selling, and some mockups of prints.
